            <h2>PM10</h2>
            <p>PM10 (Particulate Matter 10) refers to airborne particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less. These particles originate from sources such as vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and natural events like wildfires and dust storms. Due to their small size, PM10 can be inhaled and cause respiratory issues, making them a significant concern for air quality and public health.</p>

            <h2>CO2</h2>
            <p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless gas naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere. It is produced by natural processes like respiration and volcanic eruptions, as well as human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. While CO2 is essential for photosynthesis, excessive emissions contribute to global warming and climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>CO</h2>
            <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and toxic gas produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. It is commonly emitted from vehicle exhaust, industrial processes, and household appliances like gas stoves and heaters. When inhaled, CO binds to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing oxygen transport and potentially causing serious health effects, including dizziness, confusion, and even death in high concentrations.</p>

            <h2>TVOC</h2>
            <p>Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) refer to a group of organic chemicals that easily evaporate into the air at room temperature. They originate from sources like paints, cleaning products, building materials, and vehicle emissions. High concentrations of TVOCs can negatively impact indoor and outdoor air quality, leading to health effects such as headaches, dizziness, respiratory irritation, and long-term exposure risks.</p>

            <h2>NO2</h2>
            <p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a reddish-brown gas with a sharp odor, primarily produced by burning fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants, and industrial processes. It is a major air pollutant that contributes to smog and acid rain. Exposure to high levels of NO₂ can cause respiratory issues, aggravate asthma, and reduce lung function, making it a significant concern for public health and air quality.</p>
